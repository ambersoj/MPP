Finalization of UML & Documentation Before Implementation

Before we proceed with coding, let's clarify:

    What it means for UML and Docs to be aligned ✅
    How we will systematically verify completeness 🔍
    What specific updates are needed 📑

✅ 1. What Does it Mean for UML and Docs to Be Aligned?

📌 UML & Docs are aligned when:

    Every class, method, and interaction in the UML has a corresponding description in the documentation.
    Every documented feature has a representation in the UML (class diagram, sequence diagrams).
    Every major component (CoreService, NetService, CommandProcessor, SocketManager, etc.) has:
        Clearly defined responsibilities
        Described interactions with other components
        Defined expected behavior

🔍 2. Establishing a Review Process

We will not write a single line of new code until we've confirmed these things are in place.
✅ UML Verification Checklist

    Does UML have all necessary classes?
    Does it correctly represent the data flow?
    Do relationships (associations, compositions) correctly reflect reality?
    Do we have sequence diagrams that capture command execution flow?

✅ Documentation Verification Checklist

    Does MPP_Design.md describe all behaviors & interactions?
    Are command processing steps clearly explained?
    Can a new developer understand & contribute based on this doc?
    Can this document serve as a reference for testing?

✅ Only when both UML and Docs pass this checklist do we move to implementation.
📑 3. Specific Updates Needed

Here’s what we should update and review together before implementation:
1️⃣ UML Adjustments

✅ Review Class Diagram

    Ensure CommandProcessor properly connects with CoreService.
    Verify Command objects are correctly linked.

✅ Review Sequence Diagram (Command Execution)

    Show CoreService receiving a command, calling CommandProcessor, executing ICommand.
    Ensure SocketManager’s role is clearly depicted.

2️⃣ Documentation Adjustments

✅ MPP_Design.md should be explicit about Command Processing
Right now, this is all we have:

- **Command Processing**: User-defined commands processed dynamically.

📌 We need to expand this to include:

    How commands are registered
    How they are executed
    How they are logged
    What happens when an unknown command is received
    A step-by-step example of how a “start” command flows through the system

🚀 Next Steps
1️⃣ Update UML & Docs Together

📌 You & I will review the UML and MPP_Design.md together.
✅ I will send a detailed MPP_Design.md update draft for your review.
✅ I will also send an updated sequence diagram for execution flow.
2️⃣ Conduct a Final Review

📌 You & I will go through the checklist.
📌 If we both agree everything is covered, we proceed to implementation.
Final Confirmation from You

🔥 Does this process feel right?
🔥 Do you have any thoughts on this before I send the updated docs & UML?
