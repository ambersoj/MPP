MPP Design Document
1. Overview
1.1 Purpose

The Modular Packet Processor (MPP) is a UNIX-based microservice-driven framework for network packet capture, processing, and command execution. It enables plug-and-play extensibility, user-defined commands, and distributed MPP nodes.
1.2 Key Features

    Microservice Architecture: Independent modules for core logic, network capture, and logging.
    User-Defined Commands: Dynamically register and execute custom commands.
    UNIX Socket Communication: Efficient IPC for low-latency command exchange.
    Extensibility: Supports user-developed services and plugins.

2. Core Features
2.1 Command Processing
2.1.1 Overview

MPP enables the dynamic execution of user-defined commands via a modular Command Processor. Commands can be registered at runtime and invoked over IPC.
2.1.2 Design

    Implements the Command Pattern with:
        ICommand (Abstract Interface)
        Concrete Command Implementations (StartCommand, StopCommand, etc.)
        Command Processor (Registry & Dispatcher)
    Command execution is asynchronous, supporting distributed processing.

2.1.3 Implementation Checklist

Define ICommand interface
Implement command registry
Enable runtime command registration
IPC-based command execution via UNIX sockets

    Logging and debugging support

2.2 Network Packet Capture
2.2.1 Overview

MPP integrates libpcap for network traffic monitoring. It captures, filters, and processes packets dynamically.
2.2.2 Design

    Core Service initializes capture threads.
    Filter Module applies user-defined packet rules.
    Processing Pipeline supports real-time analysis and exporting.

2.2.3 Implementation Checklist

Integrate libpcap for packet capture
Develop filter and processing modules
Enable real-time data streaming

    Support saving and exporting packet logs

2.3 Interprocess Communication (IPC)
2.3.1 Overview

MPP components communicate via UNIX domain sockets, ensuring low-latency command processing and service orchestration.
2.3.2 Design

    SocketManager abstracts UNIX socket interactions.
    MPP-Core listens for incoming commands.
    MPP-Net processes and forwards network-related tasks.

2.3.3 Implementation Checklist

Establish reliable UNIX socket communication
Develop a unified IPC message format
Ensure robust error handling and recovery

    Benchmark IPC performance for optimization

MPP-Logger	Manages logging across all components.
SocketManager	Manages UNIX sockets for IPC.
4. Extensibility & Future Enhancements
4.1 Plugin System

    Enable user-defined services via dynamically loaded shared libraries (.so/.dylib).

4.2 Distributed MPP Mesh

    Support inter-node communication across multiple MPP instances.

4.3 Web Interface

    Implement a lightweight web UI for visualization and remote control.

5. Development Process & Guidelines
5.1 Code Standards

    Follow Google C++ Style Guide.
    Use RAII for resource management.
    Ensure thread safety in concurrent operations.

5.2 Git Workflow

    Feature branches for all changes.
    Pull requests with code reviews.
    Automated unit tests before merging.

5.3 Testing Strategy

    Unit Testing: Catch2 framework for component tests.
    Integration Testing: End-to-end system validation.
    Performance Testing: Benchmark UNIX socket IPC latency.
