# **MPP Design Document**
### *Microservices Processing Platform (MPP)*

## 📌 **1. Overview**
MPP is a modular, microservices-based system for **handling commands, executing tasks, and extending functionality** via user-defined services and commands. It uses **UNIX sockets** for IPC and supports **dynamic command execution**.

## 🔥 **2. Core Features**
- **Command Processing**: User-defined commands processed dynamically.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Decoupled components communicating via sockets.
- **Custom Services**: Plug-and-play user-defined services.
- **Distributed Execution**: Future roadmap to support MPP mesh networks.
- **Lightweight DSL**: Simple **domain-specific language** for automation.

## 🏗 **3. System Architecture**
### **Core Components**
1. **CoreService** – Manages commands, forwards to handlers.
2. **NetService** – Handles network-related commands.
3. **CommandProcessor** – Registry for command execution.
4. **SocketManager** – Abstracts UNIX socket operations.
5. **Logger** – Centralized logging system.

### **Interaction Flow**

Client → [MPP Core] → Command Processor → (Executes Command / Dispatches to Service)
