# **MPP Design Document**
### *Microservices Processing Platform (MPP)*

## üìå **1. Overview**
MPP is a modular, microservices-based system for **handling commands, executing tasks, and extending functionality** via user-defined services and commands. It uses **UNIX sockets** for IPC and supports **dynamic command execution**.

## üî• **2. Core Features**
- **Command Processing**: User-defined commands processed dynamically.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Decoupled components communicating via sockets.
- **Custom Services**: Plug-and-play user-defined services.
- **Distributed Execution**: Future roadmap to support MPP mesh networks.
- **Lightweight DSL**: Simple **domain-specific language** for automation.

MPP Design Document
1. Overview

The Modular Processing Platform (MPP) is a microservices-based system that allows users to define, execute, and extend commands dynamically. It is designed with modularity, extensibility, and scalability in mind.

2. Core Features

    Command Processing: User-defined commands processed dynamically.
    Microservices: Independent modules handling commands, networking, and execution.
    Inter-Process Communication (IPC): Using UNIX domain sockets for efficient message passing.
    Event Logging: Structured logs for debugging and audit trails.

3. Command Processing (Detailed Design)
3.1 Overview

The Command Processing System is responsible for:

    Receiving commands through UNIX sockets.
    Parsing and validating commands.
    Executing the appropriate registered command handler.

3.2 Components

    CommandProcessor
        Stores registered commands in a map.
        Validates and dispatches commands to their respective handlers.
        Logs execution steps.

    Command Interface (ICommand)
        Defines the execute() method implemented by all concrete commands.

    Concrete Commands
        Implement ICommand and provide custom execution logic.
        Example: StartCommand, StopCommand.

    SocketManager
        Handles network communication between services.
        Receives raw command input and forwards it to CommandProcessor.

3.3 Command Lifecycle

üìå How a Command Flows Through MPP

    User sends a command (e.g., "start") through the command socket.
    SocketManager reads the command and forwards it to CommandProcessor.
    CommandProcessor checks if the command exists in the command registry.
        ‚úÖ If exists ‚Üí Executes the registered handler.
        ‚ùå If unknown ‚Üí Logs an error.
    The Concrete Command executes its logic (e.g., StartCommand initiates network monitoring).
    Logs are recorded for debugging & monitoring.

3.4 Sequence Diagram

üìå The UML Sequence Diagram will visualize the steps above.

    User sends "start" command.
    CommandProcessor validates and executes the command.
    StartCommand performs its action and logs the event.

(Sequence Diagram will be sent in the next step!)
4. Implementation Plan

üìå Next Steps 1Ô∏è‚É£ Review this design and align with UML.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Unit Tests before writing implementation code.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Finalize UML diagrams and sequence flow.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Start structured code implementation.
Final Review Checklist

‚úÖ Does the Command Processing design match UML?
‚úÖ Are all command lifecycle steps clear?
‚úÖ Does the design support extensibility for future commands?
